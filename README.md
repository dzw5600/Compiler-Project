# Compiler-Project

C* is a statically typed language that enforces all type checks at
compile time.​

Uses familiar C‑style syntax (braces, semicolons) and standard
control structures (if, for, while).​

Supports primitive types: int, float, bool, char, and string.​

Omits pointers and manual memory management for a simpler,
safer model.​

Designed as a minimal C subset to illustrate and teach each
compiler phase.​
